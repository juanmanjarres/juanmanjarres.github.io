## The Problem

It's hard to be on debt and at the same time keep track of your finances. I found myself in that position, hence I built this app. It helps you keep track of any extra payments you make to your loan, so that you avoid interest as much as possible!

## The Solution

Loan Calculator is a streamlined mobile application, which is easy to access and use. With just some basic data about your loan, the app gives you a nice, easy-to-understand graph that is
accurate with your amortization schedule.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend + Backend**: Flutter and Dart
- **Graphing Utility**: `fl_chart` for Flutter
- **Deployment**: Google Play Store

## My Role

As the solo developer on this project, I handled all aspects from initial concept through design, development, testing, and deployment. While it's still under development, I'm working closely with a small group of beta users to refine the experience through multiple iterations.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Displaying an accurate graph for amortization.

**Solution**: Created custom mathematical formulas to calculate the amortization schedule and used the `fl_chart` library to display the data in an easy-to-understand graph.

**Challenge**: Creating nice, easy-to-use UI.

**Solution**: Used Flutter's built-in widgets, the Material library and custom widgets to create a clean, intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
