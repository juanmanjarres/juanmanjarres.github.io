Nice to meet you! I'm Juan, originally from BogotÃ¡, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ and currently living in Saskatoon, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I'm working as a Junior Software Developer working for FarmTRX at Troo Corp.

I'm passionate about open source software, and I'm always looking for ways to incorporate it into my projects, as well as contributing to the community! Currently, I use Flutter/Dart for mobile development, but I have also used JavaScript, TypeScript, node.js and SQL while working as a Full Stack Developer, as well as C++, Java, Python, C, Linux, Docker and other technologies throughout my undergraduate degree.

I graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science in 2023. I love new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about tech! ðŸ˜„
